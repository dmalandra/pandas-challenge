This report provides a high-level description of educational KPIs within a school district, as well as a more detailed summary of the individual schools within the district.

KPIs that are of importance in the dataset include average math and reading scores, percentage of students passing math and reading (>=70% grades), as well as the percentage of students passing overall.  Total budgets for each of the 15 schools in the district, as well as the budgets allocated per student were also considered.  Sorted and reorganized dataframes are summarized at the individual school level, as well.
